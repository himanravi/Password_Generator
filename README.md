# Password_Generator
Password-SPA is a lightweight, single-page application that generates cryptographically strong passwords in the browser. Built with Node.js/Express on the backend and vanilla JS on the frontend, it ships zero external APIs or databasesâ€”just clone, npm install, npm start and open localhost:3000.
